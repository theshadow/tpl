#+TITLE: TPL the smallest template engine I could write
* Introduction

Why tpl at all? It sounded like fun and I wanted a general purpose template tool that I could use in code generation.
Following the unix principal of a small tool that does one thing and one thing well I started this project. Since I've
really taken a like to the Go programming language I felt it made sense to use their built in =text/template= library.

It works by taking a =text/template= formatted file and a JSON file and writes the combined output to =os.Stdout=

* Usage

=tpl [options] template-file data-file=

- options :: The optional flags which allow you to specify options for input and output.
- template-file :: A =text/template= formatted file
- data-file :: A JSON key-map formatted file.
